Description: mIFsim is an easy-to-use wrapper package for spatstat that allows users to simulate mulitplex immunofluorescence (mIF) data. The simulation of this data comes in a could different functions whether since cell clustering (univariate) or multiple cell clustering/colocalization (bivariate) is wanting to be explored. The main audience for this package is those wanting to validate or test hypotheses or methods on controllable abundance/clustering of cells within mIF data.
